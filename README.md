# CographGeneration
Cograph Generation (linear delay) - format g6

This code is the implementation of the algorithm capable of generating all the cographs (connected and / or disconnected) with fixed number of vertices. The cographs obtained are written in graph6 () format. On link below all the related graphs (in .g6 format) are available up to 19 vertices. Where you will also find a code executable.

The theory involved in the construction of this algorithm was published in the following article:

Jones, Átila A., Fábio Protti, and Renata R. Del-Vecchio. "Cograph generation with linear delay." Theoretical Computer Science 713 (2018): 1-10.
